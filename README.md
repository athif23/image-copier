# Image Copier
üñ®Ô∏è Duplicate your images easier and faster.

#### Why?
Have you ever had a situation, where you have an image that you want to multiply or duplcate but you are just too lazy to even use something like Publisher, Word, etc.? I had that situation. So that's why I make this app, to make it easier for me to duplicate or multiply an image without having me open the apps above. üòâ
