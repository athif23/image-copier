# Image Copier
üñ®Ô∏è Duplicate your images easier and faster.

#### Why?
Have you ever had a situation, where you have an image that you want to multiply or duplcate but you are just too lazy to even use something like Publisher, Word, etc.? I had that situation. So that's why I make this app, to make it easier for me to duplicate or multiply an image without having me open the apps above. üòâ

#### Features
- Set margin or space of each copies more easily.
- Preview how it looks like in realtime.
- Auto fill the page, so you don't need to count how many copies you need ;)
- Lock the ratio of your image. Makes your image proportional.
- Warning you, when you're doing something weird.
- Can crop image
- Responsive in mobile or tablet
- Zoom in and out.
- Save them as PDF or Image file.
