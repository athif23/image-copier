## üñ®Ô∏è Image Copier üñ®Ô∏è
üñ®Ô∏è A tool to make copying your images a little more easier.

#### Why?
Have you ever had a situation, where you have an image that you want to multiply or copy it but you are too lazy to even use something like Publisher, Word, or Photoshop? I had that situation. So, I make this tool or app, to make it easier for me to copy or multiply an image without having to open the apps above. Or on another point... I'm just lazy. So if you are also lazy like me, use this! üòâ

*And also, this tool is intended for people that have zero experience with the apps above.*

#### Features
- Set image's width and height more easily.
- Set margin or space of each copies more easily.
- Preview how it looks like in realtime.
- Many more settings of your image to.
- Auto fill the page, so you don't need to count how many you need to copy ;)
- Lock the ratio of your image. Makes your image balance.
- Save as PDF or Image file.
